# Advent of Code! 2017! In HASKELL!

Last year I did enjoy participating to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) with a language I already knew pretty well, Javascript ([repo here](https://github.com/GiovanniFrigo/advent-of-code-2016)).
Although I didn't really finish it due to time constraints, I'm challenging myself again this year!


## Haskell!
This year I fell in love with Haskell, and since I don't really have the chance to use it in my daily job, why not using it in this challenge? 😁

I am really a newbie so my code can be really awful, but hey! one has to start somewhere, right? 🙈

## IDE

I'm using [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com/) as IDE, because it helps me a lot with type definitions and quick access to documentation, so all the files in this repo are inside the `adventofcode.hsproj` file.

However, that file can be explored as a folder on OSX so all the modules of the daily challenges can be seen, opened, edited and run individually (`Day1.hs`, `Day1p2.hs`,..)

## Journal

Just like last year, I will keep a journal of the most challenging/interesting things I'll learn during this journey.
